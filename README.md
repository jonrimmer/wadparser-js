A JavaScript conversion of Jason Sperske's [WADParser.py](https://gist.github.com/jasonsperske/42284303cf6a7ef19dc3) script.

Requires a modern, up-to-date browser with support for `type="module"` scripts. At the time of writing, this requires turning on an about:config flag in Firefox.

Tests expect c1m1.wad from Freedoom to be in the directory, and to be run in a recent version of Node.
